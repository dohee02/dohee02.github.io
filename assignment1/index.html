      <h1><a href="https://brooomstick.com/#gallery">THE MAN WHOSE WORK WE DON'T NOTICE</a></h1>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>

      The first thing I noticed when interacting with this experience was the color combination used and the message it
      conveyed. The page is discussing the importance of professions like janitorial work that often go unnoticed. To
      effectively convey this message, the janitorial profession was depicted transparently, while other members of the
      public were represented in a single shade of green. This helped differentiate between the public and the
      janitorial profession, making the public's indifference palpable.

      <h2>2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your discrete actions.</h2>
      <p>During this experience, I primarily engaged in scrolling interactions. As I scrolled:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Character images moved, and trash disappeared.</li>
        <li>Buildings were covered with trash.</li>
        <li>There are galleries related to the topic.</li>
        <li>Characters easily throw trash.</li>
        <li>Transparently depicted characters regained color.</li>
      </ul>

      By scrolling up and down, I could immerse myself more in the thematic elements.

      <h2>3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>

      The part where I invested the most time was understanding the four themes represented on the website and how
      perceptions of the janitorial profession have evolved. By scrolling and interacting with images and elements, I
      could actively engage with the story more.

      <h2>4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>

      The most common action during my interaction was recognizing the changes displayed while scrolling. Most of the
      interactions I've experienced with previous web pages primarily involved static information representation.
      Examples include shopping sites, school homepages, search engines, or drives. However, this experience allowed me
      to dynamically receive thematic storytelling through webpage scrolling. I was most interested in immersing myself
      in the story by scrolling.

      <h2>5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>

      For websites, I believe it's essential to convey information to users and guide them toward desired actions. In
      the case of the website I experienced, the goal was to convey a message to users about the past and present of
      janitorial work and how people should perceive them.

      <h2>6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>

      The strength of interactive experiences lies in engaging users through bidirectional expression. Simply delivering
      information unilaterally to users is inefficient for a webpage. For example, even when reading a newspaper, we
      consider layouts that effectively deliver information to users with prominent headlines, well-organized text, and
      images underneath. Websites can add more interactive elements than newspapers. By allowing users to directly cause
      changes in the web space through actions like scrolling, the experience facilitates bidirectional communication,
      making users more immersed.

      <h2>
        7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many
        different times)
      </h2>

      The website I experienced seems more like a one-time information delivery about a single message. I consider it
      more of a short-term interaction. I don't think people need to revisit or spend a long time on this page. However,
      that doesn't mean the message was inefficiently delivered to the public.

      <h2>8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>

      While this website primarily delivers information in the short term, the message conveyed by the website can move
      people's hearts, change their actions, and continue to convey thematic awareness through the webpage to new
      people. However, if they are sufficiently inspired, I believe they will encourage others to check the message and
      spread it.

      <h2>9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>

      As I viewed this website, it reminded me of presentation materials used in public speaking. Firstly, it simplifies
      the use of colors to draw attention to the message. Secondly, it emphasizes important messages by using bold text
      to highlight what is being conveyed. Additionally, in presenting the evolution of perceptions about past
      janitorial work, it used various images and materials, reminding me of museums or art galleries. Furthermore, it
      was laid out like a notebook, with casual doodles added.

      <h2>
        10) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research
        experience?
      </h2>

      Since this website is structured like presentation material in public speaking, people can easily understand it as
      if they are listening to a speech or story while scrolling. By arranging information similar to spaces in museums
      or art galleries, people can recognize which image material they should focus on.

      <h2>
        11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research
        experience?
      </h2>

      As this website resembles presentation material in public speaking, it allows users to immerse themselves more in
      the theme by emphasizing important parts. Additionally, by adding casual doodles, it prevents information delivery
      from becoming tedious. Therefore, users can engage with the thematic elements without getting bored, simply by
      skimming through the website for a short period.

      <h2>12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>

      The most disappointing part of this website is that it mostly presents interactions related to scrolling. While
      there is some interaction through clicking at the end, it's minimal. I believe incorporating more diverse
      interactions like clicking or dragging would make the experience more enjoyable for participants.

      <h2>13) What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>

      The most satisfying part for me was the correlation between the beginning and the end. At the beginning, the
      janitor was transparently depicted as losing color, and towards the end, there was interaction where the color was
      gradually regained. This allowed users to see changing images through their interaction. Therefore, users feel
      that the message of the website is being conveyed, and they are hopeful that perceptions of janitors will change
      positively in the future.
